# About

For many years, Julia wandered through life, aimless and confused. Then one fateful wintry evening, she ate a slice of warm, delicious homemade apple pie. From that moment forth, she lived with a newfound purpose: to achieve excellence in pie-making.

Julia is now a software engineer at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com). When she isn’t working, sleeping, or listening to [The Dave Chang Show](https://www.theringer.com/the-dave-chang-show), you’ll find her fraternizing with pigeons, frequenting [PianoFight](https://www.pianofight.com)—and of course, baking scrumptious [pie](https://www.instagram.com/juliamakespies).
